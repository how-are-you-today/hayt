      title: 'The Link Between Mental Health and Exercise 💪😃',
      content:
        "The positive impact of exercise on mental health is a powerful motivator that should not be underestimated. The link between physical activity and emotional well-being is undeniable. Let\'s explore this connection together. 🏃‍♂️🌞\n\n𝟏. 𝐌𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Exercise has an immediate effect on our mood. When we engage in physical activities, our brain releases endorphins, often referred to as \"feel-good\" hormones. These endorphins act as natural mood elevators which help us to reduce feelings of stress. A gym session, or a yoga class can help you feel more relaxed, content, and happy. 😊🚶‍♀️\n  \n𝟐. 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Life's daily stressors can take a toll on our mental health. Regular exercise can serve as a powerful stress buster. Physical activity helps lower cortisol levels, the hormone responsible for stress. This reduction in stress hormones can lead to better stress management and an improved overall sense of well-being. 🧘‍♂️🌿\n\n𝟑. 𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Exercise isn't just good for your body; it's also great for your brain. Studies have shown that physical activity can improve cognitive function, memory, and focus. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, promoting the growth of new neurons and supporting existing ones. This can help combat cognitive decline and reduce the risk of conditions like Alzheimer's disease. 🧠🏋️‍♀️\n\n𝟒. 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐞𝐦: Regular exercise can boost self-esteem and self-confidence. As you set and achieve fitness goals, your sense of accomplishment and self-worth naturally increase. These positive feelings can extend beyond the gym, leading to improved self-image and self-assurance in daily life. 💃🏋️‍♂️\n\n𝟓. 𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Many forms of exercise involve social engagement, whether through group fitness classes, team sports, or outdoor activities. This social interaction can combat feelings of loneliness and isolation, fostering a sense of belonging and community. And it's a chance to build meaningful relationships and feel connected to others 🤗🏀\n\nIncorporating exercise into your routine, even in small doses, can have profound effects on your mental health. It's a holistic approach to wellness that not only keeps your body fit but also nurtures your mind and soul. So, the next time you're feeling stressed, anxious, or down, consider going for a jog, joining a dance class, or hitting the gym. Your mental health will thank you. 🌟💕",

This is a silent and stealthy disease that makes you suffer at any time without knowing the reasons. Your thoughts convince you that you are lonely and unworthy of love\nThose thoughts continuously appear and can not be stopped by yourself.\nHowever, in positive aspects, some people who overcame their mental problems have given us some encouraging messages.\n1️⃣ \"𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠, 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐩 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐞𝐩𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬\"\nBeing brave … or something like is very common.  \nPatients who had mental treatments know that overcoming depression is not about becoming a superhero or becoming a  strong man, but about knowing to apply strategies which they were taught. It means that they knew they should select which thoughts they needed to have when they felt hopeless. This is a way to learn how to see themselves through other sights and understand their cases to give the right reactions. Depression is the unstoppable battle against a version of themselves that they need to recalibrate through learning and a healthier and more compassionate introspection.\n2️⃣ \"𝐈 𝐚𝐦 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐞 \"\nToxic thoughts are significantly dangerous for depressed patients. They always think that they can not connect with others and do not deserve to be loved. And common reaction is self-isolation.\nDuring the process of healing and coping with depression, patients become aware of negative thoughts that are hidden in a metaphorical 'invisible dark room'.

They learn to adjust reasonably their emotions to appropriate to each circumstances.\n4️⃣ \" 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐝𝐚𝐲\"\nDepression derives from losing direction in life. It means that depressed patients do not have any target or a small purpose to exist. They gradually lose feelings of setting a goal to complete, and thus joy, interest and motivation completely disappear in their lives.\nPeople who overcame their episodes are striving to set a goal every day. They, furthermore, have a dream and determination to realize their dream.\n5️⃣ \"𝐓𝐢𝐧𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐲 𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐬𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧\"\nAs they lose the joy and interest mentioned above, they are struck with a quagmire of depression. Some tiny activities like walking, reading a book a life-saving branches to pull them out of that quagmire. Their smile will come back soon.\n6️⃣\" 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐬\"\nEvery patient has different depression symptoms and levels of disease, and thus they will get distinguished treatments based on science fundamentals and levels of each patient. So, do not worry about why they can overcome that treatment, but you can not\n7️⃣ \"𝐌𝐲 𝐞𝐩𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧, 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝\"\nDepression is not a simple disease, which can not be treated once time.

This means that if they want to overcome depression, they will  leave many things behind their back. \"𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐛𝐲 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 𝐚𝐭 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭\"\nIn fact, there are no patients who can see the exit gate of the room of negative thoughts, if no experts take their hands.
